**Here's a breakdown of the tasks we need to complete to create the "Role Fit Radar" application:**

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Set up a new directory for your project.
   - Initialize a Git repository if you plan to version control your code.
   - Create a virtual environment for Python to manage dependencies.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install required Python libraries such as Streamlit, spaCy, and pdfplumber.
   - You can use a `requirements.txt` file to list these dependencies for easy installation.

3. **Design User Interface**:
   - Plan the layout and design of your application's user interface.
   - Decide on the elements you'll need, such as file upload buttons, text input fields, and result displays.
   - You can use pen and paper, a wireframing tool, or directly design in Streamlit.

4. **Implement Core Functionality**:
   - Write code to parse PDF resumes using pdfplumber.
   - Implement an ATS scoring algorithm to analyze resumes.
   - Develop logic to compare job roles and resumes for compatibility.

5. **Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Utilize spaCy or other NLP libraries to extract relevant information from resumes.
   - Implement keyword matching or entity recognition to assess skillsets and experience.

6. **Build User Interface with Streamlit**:
   - Create a Streamlit Python script (`app.py`) to build the user interface.
   - Implement the planned layout and design using Streamlit's components and widgets.

7. **Test Application**:
   - Test each component of your application to ensure it functions as expected.
   - Upload sample resumes and job roles to verify parsing, scoring, and compatibility checking.

8. **Refine and Debug**:
   - Identify and fix any bugs or issues in your code.
   - Optimize performance and ensure efficient resource usage.

9. **Documentation**:
   - Write documentation for your application, including a README file.
   - Document installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information.

10. **Deployment**:
    - Choose a deployment platform such as Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS.
    - Deploy your application and make it accessible online.

11. **Maintenance and Updates**:
    - Monitor your application for any issues or errors.
    - Address user feedback and suggestions for improvements.
    - Keep dependencies up to date and apply necessary updates.

By completing these tasks, we will be able to create a functional and reliable **"Role Fit Radar"** application.
